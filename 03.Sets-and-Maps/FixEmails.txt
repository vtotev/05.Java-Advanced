Fix Emails
------------------
You are given a sequence of strings, each on a new line, until you receive "stop" command. First string is a name of a person. On the second line you receive his email. Your task is to collect their names and emails, and remove emails whose domain ends with "us", "uk" or “com” (case insensitive). Print:
{name} – > {email}
