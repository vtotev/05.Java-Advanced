Product Shop
--------------
Write a program that prints information about food shops in Sofia and the products they store. Until the "Revision" command you will receive an input in the format: "{shop}, {product}, {price}"
Take in mind that if you receive a shop you already have received, you must collect its product information.
Your output must be ordered by shop name and must be in the format:
{shop}->
Product: {product}, Price: {price}
The price should be formated to one digit after the decimal point.
