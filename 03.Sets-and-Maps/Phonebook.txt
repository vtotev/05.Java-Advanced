Phonebook
-----------------------
Write a program that receives some info from the console about people and their phone numbers.
You are free to choose the manner in which the data is entered; each entry should have just one name and one number (both of them strings). If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, simply update its number.
After filling this simple phonebook, upon receiving the command "search", your program should be able to perform a search of a contact by name and print her details in format "{name} -> {number}". In case the contact isn't found, print "Contact {name} does not exist." Examples:
