Froggy
-------------------
Let's play a game. You have a tiny little Frog, and a Lake with numbers. The Lake and its numbers, you will get by an input from the console. Imagine, your Frog belongs to the Lake. The Frog jumps only when "END" command is received. When the Frog starts jumping, print on the console each number the Frog has stepped over. To calculate the jumps, use the guide lines: 
The jumps start from the 0th index. And follows the pattern - first all even indexes in ascending order(0->2->4->6 and so on) and then all odd indexes in ascending order (1->3->5->7 and so on). Consider the 0th index as even.
Long story short: Create a Class "Lake", it should implement the interface - "Iterable". Inside the Lake, create a Class - "Frog" and implement the interface "Iterator". Keep in mind, you will be given integers only.

Input
-------------------
The input will consist of two lines. First line - the initial numbers of the lake, separated by comma and a single space. Second line command is "END".

Output
-------------------
When you receive "END", the input is over. Foreach the collection of numbers the Frog has jumped over and print each element.
The output should be print on a single line.
Format:
{number}, {second number}, {third number} …

Constraints
-------------------
•	Lake's numbers will be valid integers in the range [2-32…232-1].
•	The command will always be valid - "END".
