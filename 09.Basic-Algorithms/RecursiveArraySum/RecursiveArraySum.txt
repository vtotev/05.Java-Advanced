Recursive Array Sum
-----------------------
Write a program that finds the sum of all elements in an integer array. Use recursion.
Note: In practice recursion should not be used here (instead use an iterative solution), this is just an exercise.

Examples

Input		Output
-----------------------
1 2 3 4		10
-1 0 1		0


Hints
-----------------------
Write a recursive method. It will take as arguments the input array and the current index. 
•	The method should return the current element + the sum of all next elements.
•	The recursion should stop when there are no more elements in the array.
