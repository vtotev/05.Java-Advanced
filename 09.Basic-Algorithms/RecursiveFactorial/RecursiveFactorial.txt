Recursive Factorial
------------------------
Write a program that finds the factorial of a given number. Use recursion.
Note: In practice, recursion should not be used here. Instead, you should use an iterative solution. This type of solution is for exercise purposes.

Examples

Input		Output
------------------------
5		120
10		3628800


Hints
------------------------
Write a recursive method. It will take as arguments an integer number.
•	The method should return the current element + the result of calculating factorial of current element - 1 (obtained by recursively calling it).
•	The recursion should stop when there are no more elements in the array.
