Hot Potato
--------------
Hot potato is a game in which children form a circle and start passing a hot potato. The counting starts with the fist kid. Every nth toss the child left with the potato leaves the game. When a kid leaves the game, it passes the potato forward. This continues repeating until there is only one kid left.
Create a program that simulates the game of Hot Potato.  Print every kid that is removed from the circle. In the end, print the kid that is left last.
