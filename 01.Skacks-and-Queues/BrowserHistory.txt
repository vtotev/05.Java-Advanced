Browser History
----------------
Write a program which takes 2 types of browser instructions:
•	Normal navigation: a URL is set, given by a string
•	The string "back" that sets the current URL to the last set URL
After each instruction the program should print the current URL. If the back instruction can’t be executed, print 
"no previous URLs". The input ends with "Home" command, then simply you have to stop the program.

Hints
----------------
•	Use ArrayDeque<>
•	Use String to keep current page
•	Use push(), when moving to next page
•	Use pop(), when going back
