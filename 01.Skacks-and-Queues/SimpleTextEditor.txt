Simple Text Editor
------------------
You are given an empty text. Your task is to implement 4 types of commands related to manipulating the text:
•	"1 [string]" - appends [string] to the end of the text
•	"2 [count]" - erases the last [count] elements from the text
•	"3 [index]" - returns the element at position [index] from the text
•	"4" - undoes the last not-undone command of type 1 or 2 and returns the text to the state before that operation

Input
------------------
•	The first line contains N, the number of operations, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
•	Each of the following N lines contains the name of the operation, followed by the command argument, if any, separated by space in the following format "command argument". 
•	The length of the text will not exceed 1000000
•	All input characters are English letters
•	It is guaranteed that the sequence of input operation is possible to perform

Output
------------------
•	For each operation of type "3" print a single line with the returned character of that operation.
