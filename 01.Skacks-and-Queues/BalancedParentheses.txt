6.	Balanced Parentheses
----------------------------
Given a sequence consisting of parentheses, determine whether the expression is balanced. A sequence of parentheses is balanced if every open parenthesis can be paired uniquely with a closed parenthesis that occurs after the former. Also, the interval between them must be balanced.
You will be given three types of parentheses: (, {, and [.
{[()]} - This is a balanced parenthesis.
{[(])} - This is not a balanced parenthesis.
----------------------------
Input
•	Each input consists of a single line, the sequence of parentheses.
•	1 ≤ Length of sequence ≤ 1000
•	Each character of the sequence will be one of the following: {, }, (, ), [, ].
----------------------------
Output
•	For each test case, print on a new line "YES" if the parentheses are balanced. Otherwise, print "NO".
Examples
Input		Output
{[()]}		YES
{[(])}		NO
{{[[(())]]}}	YES
