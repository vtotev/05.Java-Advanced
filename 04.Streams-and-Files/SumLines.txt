Sum Lines
-----------------
Write a program that reads a text file (input.txt from the Resources - Exercises) and prints on the console the sum of the ASCII symbols of each of its lines. Use BufferedReader in combination with FileReader.

Examples

Input
-----------------
On January 1 , 1533 ,

1452
1397
2606
670
1573

2762


Hints
-----------------
•	Use try-with-resources to handle file
 
•	Create a BufferedReader to read each line of the file
 
•	Get the ASCII code of each character in the line and add it to the sum for the current line and print the sum on the console
