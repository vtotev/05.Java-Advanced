Infix to Postfix
----------------
Mathematical expressions are written in an infix notations, for example "5 / ( 3 + 2 )". However, this kind of notation is not efficient for computer processing, as you first need to evaluate the expression inside the brackets, so there is a lot of back and forth movement. A more suitable approach is to convert it in the so-called postfix notations (also called Reverse Polish Notation), in which the expression is evaluated from left to right, for example "3 2 + 5 /".
Implement an algorithm that converts the mathematical expression from infix notation into a postfix notation. Use the famous Shunting-yard algorithm.

Input
----------------
•	You will receive an expression on a single line, consisting of tokens
•	Tokens could be numbers 0-9, variables a-z, operators +, -, *, / and brackets ( or )
•	Each token is separated by exactly one space

Output
----------------
•	The output should be on a single line, consisting of tokens, separated by exactly one space.

Examples
----------------
Input			Output
5 / ( 3 + 2 )		5 3 2 + /
1 + 2 + 3		1 2 + 3 +
7 + 13 / ( 12 - 4 )	7 13 12 4 - / +
( 3 + x ) - y		3 x + y -
