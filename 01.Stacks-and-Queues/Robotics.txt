Robotics
-------------------
Somewhere in the future, there is a robotics factory. The current project is assembly line robots.
Each robot has a processing time, the time it needs to process a product. When a robot is free it should take a product for processing and log his name, product and processing start time.
Each robot processes a product coming from the assembly line. A product is coming from the line each second (so the first product should appear at [start time + 1 second]). If a product passes the line and there is not a free robot to take it, it should be queued at the end of the line again.
The robots are standing on the line in the order of their appearance.

-------------------
Input
-------------------
•	On the first line, you will get the names of the robots and their processing times in format "robotName-processTime;robotName-processTime;robotName-processTime"
•	On the second line, you will get the starting time in format "hh:mm:ss"
•	Next, until the "End" command, you will get a product on each line.
