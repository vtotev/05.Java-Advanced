Browser History Upgrade
------------------------
Extend "Browser History" with a "forward" instruction which visits URLs that were navigated away from by "back"
Each forward instruction visits the next most-recent such URL. If a normal navigation happens, all potential forward URLs are removed until a new back instruction is given If the forward instruction can’t be executed, print 
"no next URLs".

Hints
------------------------
•	Use the solution from Browser History
•	Use ArrayDequeue<> as queue to keep the forward pages
•	Use clear() method to reset the forward pages
•	Use addFirst() when adding page to the forward pages
