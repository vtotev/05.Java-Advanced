Poisonous Plants
----------------
You are given N plants in a garden. Each of these plants has been added with some amount of pesticide. After each day, if any plant has more pesticide than the plant at its left, being weaker (more GMO) than the left one, it dies. You are given the initial values of the pesticide and position of each plant. Print the number of days after which no plant dies, i.e. the time after which there are no plants with more pesticide content than the plant to their left.

Input
----------------
•	The input consists of an integer N representing the number of plants. 
•	The next single line consists of N integers, where every integer represents the position and amount of pesticides of each plant. 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000
•	Pesticides amount on a plant is between 0 and 1000000000

Output
----------------
•	Output a single value equal to the number of days after which no plants die

7			2	Initially all plants are alive. 
6 5 8 4 7 10 9			Plants = {(6, 1), (5, 2), (8, 3), (4, 4), (7, 5), (10, 6), (9, 7)} 
				Plants[k] = (i, j) => jth plant has pesticide amount = i. 
				After the 1st day, 4 plants remain as plants 3, 5, and 6 die. 
				Plants = {(6, 1), (5, 2), (4, 4), (9, 7)} 
				After the 2nd day, 3 plants survive as plant 7 dies. Plants = {(6, 1), (5, 2), (4, 4)} 
				After the 3rd day, 3 plants survive and no more plants die. 
				Plants = {(6, 1), (5, 2), (4, 4)} 
				After the 2nd day the plants stop dying.
