4.	Basic Queue Operations

You will be given an integer N representing the number of elements to enqueue (add), an integer S representing the number of elements to dequeue (remove/poll) from the queue and finally an integer X, an element that you should check whether is present in the queue. If it is print true on the console, if itâ€™s not print the smallest element currently present in the queue.

Examples

Input		Output		Comments
5 2 32		true 		We have to push 5 elements. 
1 13 45 32 4			Then we pop 2 of them. 
				Finally, we have to check whether 13 is present in the stack. Since it is we print true.
