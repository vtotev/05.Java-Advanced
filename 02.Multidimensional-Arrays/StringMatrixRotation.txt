String Matrix Rotation
----------------------
You are given a sequence of text lines. Assume these text lines form a matrix of characters (pad the missing positions with spaces to build a rectangular matrix). Write a program to rotate the matrix by 90, 180, 270, 360, … degrees. Print the result at the console as sequence of strings after receiving the “END” command.

Examples
----------------------
Input	Rotate(90)	Rotate(180)	Rotate(270)
hello
softuni
exam
END	 	 	 
 			
Input
----------------------
The input is read from the console:
•	The first line holds a command in format "Rotate(X)" where X are the degrees of the requested rotation.
•	The next lines contain the lines of the matrix for rotation.
•	The input ends with the command "END".
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

Output
----------------------
Print at the console the rotated matrix as a sequence of text lines.
Constraints
•	The rotation degrees is positive integer in the range [0…90000], where degrees is multiple of 90.
•	The number of matrix lines is in the range [1…1 000].
•	The matrix lines are strings of length 1 … 1 000.
•	Allowed working time: 0.2 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
