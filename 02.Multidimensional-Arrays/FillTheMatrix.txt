Fill the Matrix
---------------
Filling a matrix in the regular way (top to bottom and left to right) is boring. Write two methods that fill a matrix of size N x N in two different patterns. Both patterns are described below:

Examples
---------------
Input		Output
3, A		1 4 7 
		2 5 8 
		3 6 9

3, B		1 6 7 
		2 5 8
		3 4 9

Hints
---------------
•	Make a different method for each pattern
•	Make a method for printing the matrix
