Sum Matrix Elements
-------------------
Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and prints:
•	The count of rows
•	The count of columns
•	The sum of all matrix’s elements
On the first line you will get the dimensions of the matrix in format {rows, columns}. On the next lines you will get the elements for each row separated with a coma.
