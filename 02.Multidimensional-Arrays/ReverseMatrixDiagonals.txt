Reverse Matrix Diagonals
------------------------
You are given a matrix (2D array) of integers. You have to print the matrix diagonal but in reversed order. Print each diagonal on new line.

Input
------------------------
On the first line, single integer the number R of rows in the matrix. On each of the next R lines, C numbers separated by single spaces. Note that R and C may have different values. 

Output
------------------------
The output should consist of R lines, each consisting of exactly C characters, separated by spaces, representing the matrix diagonals reversed.

Constraints
------------------------
All the integers will be in the range [1â€¦.1000]
