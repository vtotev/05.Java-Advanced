Threeuple
------------------------
Now you are aware of a Class which is probably a bad practice to use. Anyway, it is a nice example of using generics. Our next task is to create another Tuple. This time, our task is harder. 
Create a Class Threeuple. Its name is telling us, that it will hold no longer, just a pair of objects. The task is simple, our Threeuple should hold three objects. Make it have getters and setters. You can even extend the previous class

Input
------------------------
The input consists of three lines:
•	The first one is holding a name, an address and a town. Format of the input: 
<<first name> <last name>> <address> <town>
•	The second line is holding a name, beer liters, and a Boolean variable - drunk or not. Format:
<name> <liters of beer> <drunk or not>
•	The last line will hold a name, a bank balance (double) and a bank name. Format: 
<name> <account balance> <bank name>

Output
------------------------
•	Print the Threeuples’ objects in format: {firstElement} -> {secondElement} -> {thirdElement}
