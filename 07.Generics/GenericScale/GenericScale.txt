Generic Scale
-------------------------
Create a class Scale<T> that holds two elements - left and right. The scale should receive the elements through its single constructor:
•	Scale(T left, T right)
The scale should have a single method: 
•	T getHeavier()
The greater of the two elements is heavier. The method should return null if elements are equal.
