Generic Box
-----------------
Create a generic class Box that can store any type. Override the toString() method to print the type and the value of the stored data in the format {class full name: value}.
Use the class that you've created and test it with the class java.lang.String. On the first line you will get n - the number of strings to read from the console. On the next n lines, you will get the actual strings. For each of them create a box and call its toString() method to print its data on the console.
