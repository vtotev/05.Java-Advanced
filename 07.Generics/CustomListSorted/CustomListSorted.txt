Custom List Sorter
---------------------
Extend the previous problem by creating an additional Sorter class. It should have a single static method sort() which can sort objects of type CustomList containing any type that can be compared. Extend the command list to support one additional command Sort:
â€¢	Sort - Sort the elements in the list in ascending order.

Examples

Input
---------------------
Add cc
Add bb
Add aa
Sort
Print
END

Output
---------------------
aa
bb
cc
